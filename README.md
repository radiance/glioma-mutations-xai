Mutation-based clustering and classification of glioma genomic mutation data to understand more about age differences

![Image of graphical abstract](/figures/graphical-abstract.png)

In this work, we use gene mutation [data](/data) from public resources to explore age specifics about glioma.
We use both an explainable [clustering](/scripts/Clustering) as well as [classification](/scripts/Classification) approach to find and interpret age based differences in brain tumor diseases.
